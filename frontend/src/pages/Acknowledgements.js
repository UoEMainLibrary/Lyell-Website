                <p>The 2019 acquisition of the Lyell notebooks required a remarkable combination of societies, grant
                    funders and individuals from across the UK and the rest of the world. In addition to major grants
                    from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Murray Family over one thousand <a
                        href="#notebook-supporters">donations</a> made the
                    purchase possible.</p>
                <h3 id="access-project">Access Project</h3>
                <p>Making the notebooks, other archive and collection materials, freely accessible required an extensive
                    programme of conservation, digitisation, curatorial and academic work, which has been supported by
                    further financial donations, including for website development from the <a
                        href="https://www.sedimentologists.org/">International Association of Sedimentologists</a>. See

                <h3 id="volunteers">Volunteers</h3>
                <p>In addition to staff and paid student interns, the Lyell Access Project has greatly benefited from a
                    wide range of volunteers and experts who contributed their time, enthusiasm and efforts. We
                    acknowledge with particular thanks the expertise received from <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Secord">Professor James Secord</a>, Felicity
                    MacKenzie, and bibliographer Stuart Baldwin (1930-2021). Thanks to Drew Coleman, Beverly Gordon,
                    Ella Fornari, Caryl Dreiblatt and Bob Burrell – and those University of Edinburgh students who
                    supported the transcription of the notebook indexes and added detail to the lists of correspondents.
