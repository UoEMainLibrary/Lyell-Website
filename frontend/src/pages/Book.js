                            when he was aged 30 and published in 1830, was the culmination of his interests, education
                            and travel. He would go on to dedicate his life to writing science and travel books.</p>
                        <p>Charles Lyell lived, worked and published in an age distinguished by growing public interest
                            in the sciences and by publishers keen to meet that interest. This was a period marked by
                            the appearance of new scientific journals and literary periodicals, and by scientific
                            societies. Publishers were keen to promote new ideas and theories, producing books in
                            expensive quarto editions and in cheaper and more widely available octavo format, and they
                            encouraged illustrations of different sorts to illuminate their texts. Lyell benefitted from
                            and responded to these circumstances. He had a good working relationship in particular with
                            the publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murray_(publisher,_born_1778)"
                                             target="_blank">John Murray</a> (1778 - 1843) who produced several editions
                            of Lyell’s <i>Principles of Geology</i>, Lyell’s first and most influential book.</p>
                        <p>Lyell’s writing process – edits, review, notes – features in a range of different formats
                            throughout the Collection held at Edinburgh University – including Lyell’s own annotated
                            copies of his publications, archival manuscripts, as well as detail recorded in the
                            notebooks. Lyell’s lectures also document his writing techniques. See also: </p>

                            literary career, detailing the thirty three editions of his books issued up to 1911, all of
                            the articles written by Lyell, biographies of Lyell, and articles and other content written
