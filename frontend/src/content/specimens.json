   "The Cockburn Geological Museum":[
     "The Cockburn Geological Museum is part of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences and is located at the Grant Institute. It holds a very extensive collection of geological specimens and historical objects, reflecting the whole spectrum of earth science materials, including minerals, rocks and fossils. The total holding of the museum exceeds 130,000 specimens and other materials - a significant portion of which relates to Charles Lyell’s work, and may have originated from his own collection, given to the University in 1927.",

Childe gathered thousands of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe.
