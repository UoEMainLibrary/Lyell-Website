    "The University of Edinburgh Lyell collection also extends to twenty-two bound volumes, A5 in size, and 30 archival boxes of Lyell’s Offprints including both A5 and A4 size documents. An offprint is a separate printing of a work that originally appeared as part of a larger publication, usually one of composite authorship such as an academic journal, magazine, or edited book. They are used by authors to promote their work, and so they are often given away, bearing an inscription from the author. This exchange of offprints can be then viewed as correspondence between scholars – and mention of the exchange between Lyell and the authors may also be found in notebooks and other correspondence series. The series of sixteen {Index Books (Coll-203/ A5 dated 1855 – 1871):'https://archives.collections.ed.ac.uk/repositories/2/archival_objects/203411'} appear to relate to the series of bound indexes, and include questions posed by Lyell and his thoughts on the papers. ",
    "Plans are in place to list Lyell’s Offprints and explore links with the Index notebooks, commencing March 2024. "
