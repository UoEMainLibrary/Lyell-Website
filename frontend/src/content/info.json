    "A remarkable survival, these 294 notebooks span Lyell’s long scientific career (1825-1874), offering an unrivalled insight into personal influences, field observations, thoughts and relationships. These notebooks were acquired in 2019 thanks to a fundraising campaign, with many generous individual and institutional donors from the UK and overseas. Highlights include his travels throughout Europe and the United States of America, the drafts of his correspondence with the likes of Charles Darwin, his geological and landscape sketches and his constant gathering of evidence and refinement of his theories.",

  "overview": [
    "The Sir Charles Lyell Collection is the sum of multiple accruals which have coalesced at the University of Edinburgh over a span of almost 100 years. The first of these accruals was a collection of letters and notes described at the time as 'The Papers of Sir Charles Lyell' presented in 1927 to the Grant Institute of Geology by Lady Lyell of Kinnordy. At the same time were given select works from Lyell's own library at Kinnordy House - many of which are inscribed by their authors, and who are known to be correspondents. These papers and books were transferred from the Grant Institute to the care of the University of Edinburgh's Library and Special Collections in two tranches main, the first arriving in 1960 and then another in 1975.   Over time, more smaller groups of records from that original deposit, that had found their way into personal collections, or stores, have been identified, and have been passed from the School of GeoSciences to the Library. In Summer 2020, Lyell’s collection of offprints were identified as being part of the library collection. ",
    "Other archival papers – and the notebooks - remained with the Lyell family at Kinnordy. Thanks to the dedicated support of leading institutions, groups and individuals, the University of Edinburgh led a successful campaign in 2019 to acquire Lyell's 294 notebooks. In 2020, the remaining papers of Sir Charles Lyell were allocated to the University of Edinburgh under the UK Government's 'Acceptance in Lieu of Inheritance Tax' scheme.",
    "The Lyell archives at the University of Edinburgh continue to grow as a number of smaller acquisitions continue to be made. These have included a series of around 100 letters, and in October 2020, an album of 118 letters and 57 portraits was acquired thanks to the support of both the Friends of the National Libraries and the Friends of Edinburgh University Library.",
    "This vast and comprehensive collection of books, papers, notebooks and offprints brought together between 1927 and 2020 are complemented at the University of Edinburgh by a collection of Lyell’s geological specimens, minerals and shells which are held by the School of GeoScience's Cockburn Geological Museum, and the School of History, Classics and Archaeology's Gorden Vere Childe Collection.",
    "These elements – books, papers, offprints and specimens - represent the tools that Lyell used, and brought together, the collection offer a holistic window into how he worked to develop ideas and thinking which inform so much of our understanding of the world today. "
