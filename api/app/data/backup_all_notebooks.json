Mr. and Mrs. Lyell stayed with James Hamilton Couper at Hopeton plantation for two weeks in January 1846. Couper was a member of the British Royal Geological Society, and Lyell was President at the time. Hopetoun plantation was established by John Couper and James Hamilton, who had immigrated to Savannah, Georgia from Scotland as teenagers. John Couper's son, James Hamilton Couper took over as estate manager, and engaged in the trafficking of 637 people from Africa in 1806 to prepare the fields of their plantation, growing sea island cotton, sugar, and rice. Two important features of the plantation were the plantation canal, for irrigation and transportation, which Lyell took particular interest in, and a portable railroad. In 1833, the plantation was lauded as being the \u201cfinest example of crop diversification and efficient slave management\u201d by a prominent southern publisher. When Lyell visited, there was likely 500 enslaved African people working 1,000 planted acres. Hopeton was a destination for many from Europe to witness slave labour, and reportedly \u201cwent away very much impressed with the humanity and skill with which James Hamilton Couper managed his slaves.\u201d In 1846, Sir Charles Lyell described Couper as \u201ca benevolent slaveowner\u201d and gained at Hopetoun \u201can hereditary regard and attachment between master and slave\u201d."

They visited geological locations around the capital Christiania (now Oslo), with the professor of geology at the University of Christiania Baltazar M. Keilhau as guide. Many of Lyell\u2019s theories about metamorphic and plutonic rocks were confirmed from his observations, and these confirmations were included in <emph render=\"italic\"> Elements of Geology </emph>, published the following year, in 1838. This was nearing the end of his two year presidency of the Geological Society, and during a tempestuous time for the science, when theories about evolution of the species were particularly divisive. In correspondence with Whewell in March of 1837 about the possibilities of the origination of new species, Lyell wrote why he left this topic to inference in Principles of Geology; \u201c\"If I had stated... the possibility of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in contradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host of prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these mysterious subjects.\u201d (Lyell to William Whewell, 7 March 1837.

He travels with Mary, Hughes, Beovill, and meets with many experts along the way. Most of the notebook is written by Buckley, who orders the narrative by date using the Itinerary \u2013 with sections added by Lyell in poor writing, and others \u2013 perhaps Mary, as well as local people noting down journey times. Whilst travelling in France, Lyell makes many geological observations \u2013 on the train, by the side of the road, at their accommodation, on excursions along rivers, visiting sites of significance and at Museums. Arriving in France, Lyell revisits the caves at Aurignac and visits local museums and collectors to see related specimens - almost like a reinvestigation - and concludes the evidence is proof of 'cave-men'. The notebook contains several hand drawn maps and sections, and concludes with measurements of Lake District lakes compiled by Harriet Martineau. "

During this time, publisher John Murray invited Lyell to write for the Tory Quarterly Review, despite his known Whig sympathies. He uses his essays to advocate the cause of moderate reform, criticising the lack of government support for the sciences, and the unreformed state of the ancient universities. He particularly laments the clerical domination of higher education in England and larger issues of University education.\nIn December of 1825, Lyell resigns as secretary of the Geological Society but is appointed its foreign secretary. He devotes more time to legal work on the Western Circuit, but also begins to plan a book expounding his belief that geology would only become scientific, if it were based on directly witnessable modern causes. \n\nIn February 1826 he is Elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He reads two papers at the Geological Society on Tertiary exposures of the Hampshire Coast, and publishes an essay in Quarterly Review on the Geological Society's publications, praising the society for abandoning speculative theorizing in favour of careful observation. \nIn August, Lyell\u2019s parents return to live permanently at Kinnordy."

During this tour, Lyell compared geological phenomena and found similarities in observations made in Forfarshire, Paris, and the southern coast of France and Italy. Roderick Impey Murchison presented a joint paper on their research to the Geological Society of London in December 1828. This trip is central to his development of Principles of Geology (1830-1833).

In May 1828, Lyell joined Roderick Impey Murchison (1792-1871) and his wife Charlotte Hugonin (1788-1869) for a fieldwork tour of France and Italy. The journey was planned expressly for geological fieldwork, the purpose of which was to educate\nthe travellers themselves, thus being closely related to what today would be called a field trip rather than field research. There were both educational and recreational aspects to the journey; Roderick Murchison referred to this journey as their (geological) Grand Tour.\n\n\nThrough travels Lyell's theories evolved. His studies of the Roman Macellum or 'Temple of Serapis' in Pozzuoli, near Naples, in 1828 provide a perfect illustration of his understanding of the impact and significance of modern marine and geological processes.\n\nA subject of concern for Lyell was the power and exclusivity of British Universities; 9 May 1828, parliament repealed the Test and Corporation Acts which had banned Catholics from holding government and public offices or from attending universities.

                    "content": "This notebook, the first of 1827, was written by Lyell early in his geological career, when he was 30 years old, and unmarried. This comes after Lyell and Buckland made their discoveries in Scotland in 1824, but whilst he was also maintaining a law practice, funded by his father. Lyell was greatly involved with the Geological Society, serving as Secretary with George Poulett Scrope in 1825, and presenting papers on Tertiary exposures of the Hampshire coast in 1826. During the course of this notebook, Lyell began writing the first drafts of Principles of Geology. The first manuscript was delivered to the publisher at the close of 1827.\n\nDuring this period, Lyell's eyes, weakened from a time spent in Tuscany as a youth, grew stronger, and allowed him to plan trips further afield to Europe. Most biographies point to this period of time when he resolved to dedicate his time to his geology work.\n\n\nWhile working as a barrister on the western circuit, Lyell reads the evolutionary theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) and realizes that the mutability of species would affect geology as much as the biological sciences. Lyell nonetheless concludes that the fossil record is too imperfect to support the theory of evolution, and that the physical world is a stable balanced system."

                    "content": "This notebook, the third of 1827, was written by Lyell early in his geological career, after Lyell and Buckland made their discoveries in Scotland in 1824, but whilst he was also maintaining a law practice, funded by his father. Lyell was greatly involved with the Geological Society, serving as Secretary with George Poulett Scrope in 1825, and presenting papers on Tertiary exposures of the Hampshire coast in 1826. During the course of this notebook, Lyell began writing the first drafts of Principles of Geology. The first manuscript was delivered to the publisher at the close of 1827.\n\nDuring this period, Lyell's eyes, weakened from a time spent in Tuscany as a youth, grew stronger, and allowed him to plan trips further afield to Europe. Most biographies point to this period of time when he resolved to dedicate his time to his geology work.\n\nWhile working as a barrister on the western circuit, Lyell reads the evolutionary theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) and realizes that the mutability of species would affect geology as much as the biological sciences. Lyell nonetheless concludes that the fossil record is too imperfect to support the theory of evolution, and that the physical world is a stable balanced system."

He is elected Fellow of the Royal Society in February of 1827, and reads two papers at the Geological Society on Tertiary exposures of the Hampshire Coast.\nHe publishes an essay in Quarterly Review on the Geological Society's publications, praising the society for abandoning speculative theorizing in favour of careful observation.

                    "content": "This notebook, the second of 1827, was written by Lyell early in his geological career, after Lyell and Buckland made their discoveries in Scotland in 1824, but whilst he was also maintaining a law practice, funded by his father. Lyell was greatly involved with the Geological Society (of London), serving as Secretary with George Poulett Scrope in 1825, and presenting papers on Tertiary exposures of the Hampshire coast in 1826. During the course of this notebook, Lyell began writing the first drafts of Principles of Geology. The first manuscript was delivered to the publisher at the close of 1827.\n\nDuring this period, Lyell's eyes, weakened from a time spent in Tuscany as a youth, grew stronger, and allowed him to plan trips further afield to Europe, but still maintain his law practice. Most biographies point to this period of time when he resolved to dedicate his time to his geology work.\n\nWhile working as a barrister on the western circuit, Lyell reads the evolutionary theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) and realizes that the mutability of species would affect geology as much as the biological sciences. Lyell nonetheless concludes that the fossil record is too imperfect to support the theory of evolution, and that the physical world is a stable balanced system. This notebook contains notes and observations while on Western Circuit in July; Geological observations on coast of Dorset and Somerset; Legal notes; Notes at Kinnordy in August."
